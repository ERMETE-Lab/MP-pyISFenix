   abstract = {The mass and momentum transfer phenomena in a compressible fluid represented by the Navier–Stokes equations are shown to convert into the Schrödinger equation for quantum mechanics. The complete Navier–Stokes equations render into an extended generalized version of Schrödinger equation. These results complement the Madelung’s (Zeitschrift für Physik 40 (3–4), pp. 322–326, 1926–1927) derivations that show how Schrödinger’s equation in quantum mechanics can be converted into the Euler equations for irrotational compressible flow. The theoretical results presented here join the classical Madelung paper to suggest the possibility that quantum effects at sub-atomic levels deal with a compressible fluid susceptible to wave propagation, rather than a particle. The link between such a fluid and the “quantum particle” is under current investigation.},

   abstract = {We describe a new approach for the purely Eulerian simulation of incompressible fluids. In it, the fluid state is represented by a C2-valued wave function evolving under the Schrödinger equation subject to incompressibility constraints. The underlying dynamical system is Hamiltonian and governed by the kinetic energy of the fluid together with an energy of Landau-Lifshitz type. The latter ensures that dynamics due to thin vortical structures, all important for visual simulation, are faithfully reproduced. This enables robust simulation of intricate phenomena such as vortical wakes and interacting vortex filaments, even on modestly sized grids. Our implementation uses a simple splitting method for time integration, employing the FFT for Schrödinger evolution as well as constraint projection. Using a standard penalty method we also allow arbitrary obstacles. The resulting algorithm is simple, unconditionally stable, and efficient. In particular it does not require any Lagrangian techniques for advection or to counteract the loss of vorticity. We demonstrate its use in a variety of scenarios, compare it with experiments, and evaluate it against benchmark tests. A full implementation is included in the ancillary materials.},

    abstract = "{As first proposed by Madelung in 1926, the analogy between quantum mechanics and hydrodynamics has been known for a long time; however, its potentialities and the possibility of using the characteristic equations of quantum mechanics to simulate the behavior of inviscid fluids have not been thoroughly investigated in the past. In this methodology, the incompressible Euler equations are thus substituted by the Schrödinger equation, turning a quasi-linear Partial Differential Equation into a linear one, an algorithm known in the literature as Incompressible Schrödinger Flow. Previous works on the subject used the Fast Fourier Transform method to solve this problem, obtaining promising results, especially in predicting vortex dynamics; this paper aims to implement this novel approach into a Finite Element framework to find a more general formulation better suited for future application on complex geometries and on test cases closer to real-world applications. Simple case studies are presented in this work to analyze the potentialities of this method: the results obtained confirm that this method could potentially have some advantages over traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics method, especially for what concerns computational savings related to the required time discretization, whilst also introducing new aspects of the algorithm, mainly related to boundary conditions, not addressed in previous works.}",
